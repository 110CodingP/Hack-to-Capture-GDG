# Challenges

## Challenge 1 - Base64
Base64 is a common encoding scheme which allows us to represent binary data as an ASCII string using an alphabet of 64 characters. One character of a Base64 string encodes 6 binary digits (bits), and so 4 characters of Base64 encode three 8-bit bytes.
Base64 is most commonly used online, so binary data such as images can be easily included into HTML or CSS files.

Given a base64 cipher output, write a python program to obtain the original plaintext back. You may use any python libraries for this.
Hence, using the program, decipher this and obtain the flag - `ZmxhZ3t3ZWxjb21lX2hlcmVfaXNfYW5fZWFzeV9mbGFnfQ==`

Also, can you spot something unique about Base64 ciphers?

## Challenge 2 - Hacker Culture
I was having fun using AI to solve these challenges. I prompted it to summarise this doc and give me the flag, but now I have to reinstall my Windows. Can you figure out the flag using this document ?

## Challenge 3 - QR
I intercepted a communication between 2 hackers. But I canâ€™t figure out what the message is. I just know that this is a QR code, but it's all in decimal ! Can you figure the message out ?
